# About
This project is still under initial development. That said, contributors are welcome as the core is already fully functional and easy to work with. This is a great time to join the development effort!

The author is a one-man-army working on this, so any extra effort is welcome :)

# Known Issues & Needed Developments
- Better strategy for bidirectional input[type="radio"].
- Better strategy for bidirectional select[multiple].
- Better underlying strategy for uni- and bi-directional databinding?
- Handlers not working within forms[playground] element. Might be related to routed-elements somehow.
- Internal bookmarks in playground stopped working.
