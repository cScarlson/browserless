Browserless is a frontend development framework inspired by Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte.

# About
This project is still under initial development. That said, contributors are welcome as the core is already fully functional and easy to work with. This is a great time to join the development effort!

The author is a one-man-army working on this, so any extra effort is welcome :)

# Known Issues & Needed Developments
- Textareas' dimensions jump back to original render when changing singling form elements (see dev/playground/forms).
- input[type="radio"] not regaining focus.
- Better underlying strategy for uni- and bi-directional databinding?
- Internal bookmarks in playground stopped working.
